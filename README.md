# Ansible Playbook Bundle (APB)

An **Ansible Playbook Bundle (APB)** is a lightweight application definition (meta-container). They are used to define and deploy complex groups of applications, deployment configs, deployments, and services to an [OpenShift Origin](https://github.com/OpenShift/origin) cluster running the [Ansible Service Broker](https://github.com/fusor/ansible-service-broker).  APBs offer more power and simple configuration by leveraging the power of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). APBs have the following features:

* Metadata contains list of required/optional parameters for use during deployment.
* Leverages existing investment in Ansible Roles / Playbooks.
* Actions under a directory with named  **_playbooks_** and metadata defined in **_apb.yml_**.
* Developer tooling to drive a guided approach.
* Easily modified or extended.

## Installing the ***apb*** tool
##### Prerequisites

    init                Initialize the directory for APB development
    help                Display this help message
    prepare             Prepare an ansible-container project for APB packaging
